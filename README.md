# Computer Architecture Project developed in Assembly

In this repository I provided the full project description in Portuguese and the Assembly project solution.

## Brief Project Description

The goal of this project was to develop a program that, given a set of points in a 2D plane, identifies k groups of points and clusters them based on their relative distances. To achieve this, the k-means clustering algorithm was implemented. During execution, the k clusters and their respective centroids are iteratively updated and displayed with distinct colors on a 32x32 matrix.
